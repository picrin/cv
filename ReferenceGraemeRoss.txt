I was Adam's line manager for the last 6 months of his 12 month period at SAS Scotland R&D. During his internship Adam was involved in a daily operation of the Build & Deploy team for a large software product developed as an international collaboration of several Research and Development teams within SAS.

Adam's main responsibility was maintenance of the version control (git), continuous integration (jenkins) and build (gradle) of a large software product developed in Java & Javascript, as well as software development in Java, Groovy and Python. 

I remember Adam as very enthusiastic and passionate collaborator, able to express himself clearly, willing to face challenges, and a good team-worker.

After several weeks Adam gained my trust and earned administrative privileges, which allowed him to perform mission-critical tasks on our infrastructure. Adam never abused this trust and I'd like to see him return to the company after he finishes his studies.
